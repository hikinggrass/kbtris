I know its not very well coded and is not very stable etc.
One reason ist that we made the project with borland c++ builder 6 and later we ported it to QT4.

TODO:
- Create a better interface

- Include a **working** highscore system (the one in the borland version was veeeery bad, so I decided to write a new version with sqlite support

-rework the whole game as its far away from good code - but it works (a little bit)
